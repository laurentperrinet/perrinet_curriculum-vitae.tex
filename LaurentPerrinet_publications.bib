    abstract = {This paper introduces a model of oculomotor control during the smooth pursuit of occluded visual targets. This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle -- the minimisation of variational free energy -- to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements -- prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.},

@article{Barthelemy08,
    abstract = {Integrating information is essential to measure the physical 2D motion of a surface from both ambiguous local 1D motion of its elongated edges and non-ambiguous 2D motion of its features such as corners or texture elements. The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course as read from tracking eye movements: first, local 1D motion signals are extracted and pooled to initiate ocular responses, then 2D motion signals are integrated to adjust the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these 1D and 2D motion computations are still unclear. One hypothesis is that their different dynamics may be explained from different contrast sensitivities. To test this, we measured contrast-response functions of early, 1D-driven and late, 2D-driven components of ocular following responses to different motion stimuli: gratings, plaids and barberpoles. We found that contrast dynamics of 1D-driven responses are nearly identical across the different stimuli. On the contrary, late 2D-driven components with either plaids or barberpoles have similar latencies but different contrast dynamics. Temporal dynamics of both 1D- and 2D-driven responses demonstrates that the different contrast gains are set very early during the response time course. Running a Bayesian model of motion integration, we show that a large family of contrast-response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of 1D and 2D motion signals for each stimulus and by the shape of the prior distribution. However, the pure delay (i.e. largely independent upon contrast) observed between 1D- and 2D-motion supports the fact that 1D and 2D probability distributions are computed independently. This two-pathway Bayesian model supports the idea that 1D and 2D mechanisms represent edges and features motion in parallel.},

@article{Bogadhi11,
    abstract = {Accuracy in estimating an object's global motion over time is not only affected by the noise in visual motion information but also by the spatial limitation of the local motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that during the initial stages of the motion information processing, 1D motion cues related to the object's edges have a dominating influence over the estimate of the object's global motion. However, during the later stages, 2D motion cues related to terminators (edge-endings) progressively take over, leading to a final correct estimate of the object's global motion. Here, we propose a recursive extension to the Bayesian framework for motion processing (Weiss, Simoncelli, & Adelson, 2002) cascaded with a model oculomotor plant to describe the dynamic integration of 1D and 2D motion information in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements. In the recurrent Bayesian framework, the prior defined in the velocity space is combined with the two independent measurement likelihood functions, representing edge-related and terminator-related information, respectively to obtain the posterior. The prior is updated with the posterior at the end of each iteration step. The maximum-a posteriori (MAP) of the posterior distribution at every time step is fed into the oculomotor plant to produce eye velocity responses that are compared to the human smooth pursuit data. The recurrent model was tuned with the variance of pursuit responses to either p̈ure\1̈D or r̈̈e\ ̈̈motion. The oculomotor plant was tuned with an independent set of oculomotor data, including the effects of line length (i.e. stimulus energy) and directional anisotropies in the smooth pursuit responses. The model not only provides an accurate qualitative account of dynamic motion integration but also a quantitative account that is close to the smooth pursuit response across several conditions (three contrasts and three speeds) for two human subjects.},

    abstract = {One core advantage of sparse representations is the efficient coding of complex signals using compact codes. For instance, it allows for the representation of any image as a combination of few elements drawn from a large dictionary of basis functions. In the context of the efficient processing of natural images, we propose here that such codes can be optimized by designing proper homeostatic rules between the elements of the dictionary. Indeed, a common design for unsupervised learning rules relies on a gradient descent over a cost measuring representation quality with respect to sparseness. The sparseness constraint introduces a competition which can be optimized by ensuring that each item in the dictionary is selected as often as others. We implemented this rule by introducing a gain normalization similar to what is observed in a balanced neural network. We validated this theoretical insight by challenging different sparse coding algorithms with the same learning rule but with or without homeostasis. The different sparse coding algorithms were chosen for their efficiency and generality. They include least-angle regression, orthogonal matching pursuit and basis pursuit. Simulations show that for a given homeostasis rule, gradient descent performed similarly the learning of a dataset of image patches. While the coding algorithm did not matter much, including homeostasis changed qualitatively the learned features. In particular, homeostasis results in a more homogeneous set of orientation selective filters, which is closer to what is found in the visual cortex of mammals. To further validate these results, we applied this algorithm to the optimization of a visual system embedded in an aerial robot. As a consequence, this biologically-inspired learning rule demonstrates that principles observed in neural computations can help improve real-life machine learning algorithms.},

    abstract = {The ``apparent motion'' illusion is evoked when stationary stimuli are successively flashed in spatially separated positions. It depends on the precise spatial and temporal separations of the stimuli. For large spatiotemporal separation, the long-range apparent motion (lrAM), it remains unclear how the visual system computes unambiguous motion signals. Here we investigated whether intracortical interactions within retinotopic maps could shape a global motion representation at the level of V1 population in response to a lrAM. In fixating monkeys, voltage-sensitive dye imaging revealed the emergence of a spatio-temporal representation of the motion trajectory at the scale of V1 population activity, shaped by systematic backward suppressive waves. We show that these waves are the expected emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the horizontal intra-cortical network. Such non-linearities explain away ambiguous correspondence problems of the stimulus along the motion path, preformating V1 population response for an optimal read-out by downstream areas.},

    abstract = {As the state-of-the-art imaging technologies became more and more advanced, yielding scientific data at unprecedented detail and volume, the need to process and interpret all the data has made image processing and computer vision also increasingly important. Sources of data that have to be routinely dealt with today applications include video transmission, wireless communication, automatic fingerprint processing, massive databases, non-weary and accurate automatic airport screening, robust night vision to name a few. Multidisciplinary inputs from other disciplines such as computational neuroscience, cognitive science, mathematics, physics and biology will have a fundamental impact in the progress of imaging and vision sciences. One of the advantages of the study of biological organisms is to devise very different type of computational paradigms beyond the usual von Neumann e.g. by implementing a neural network with a high degree of local connectivity. This is a comprehensive and rigorous reference in the area of biologically motivated vision sensors. The study of biologically visual systems can be considered as a two way avenue. On the one hand, biological organisms can provide a source of inspiration for new computational efficient and robust vision models and on the other hand machine vision approaches can provide new insights for understanding biological visual systems. Along the different chapters, this book covers a wide range of topics from fundamental to more specialized topics, including visual analysis based on a computational level, hardware implementation, and the design of new more advanced vision sensors. The last two sections of the book provide an overview of a few representative applications and current state of the art of the research in this area. This makes it a valuable book for graduate, Master, PhD students and also researchers in the field.},

Importantly, when predictive information is available about the target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM (baseline condition). This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements. To further understand the nature of this process, we investigate the effects of reinforcement on aSPEM with two distinct experiments. First, it has been previously shown that several properties of eye movements can be modulated by reinforcement paradigms based on monetary reward (Madelain et al. 2011). We adapted and extended this framework to prediction-based aSPEM, by associating a monetary reward to a criterion-matching anticipatory velocity, in the gap before the target onset. Second, it has also been reported that accurate perception per se can play the role of an efficient ecological reinforcer for visually guided saccades (Montagnini & Chelazzi, 2005). With a gaze-contingent procedure, we manipulated the discriminability of a perceptual target (appearing during the pursuit trial and followed by a discrimination task) The difficulty level of this task has been matched depending on the velocity of aSPEM. This experiment taps on the very reason to produce anticipatory tracking movement, that is to grant a quicker high-acuity vision of the moving target. We compare predictive anticipatory eye movements across these conditions.},

    abstract = {Trends in programming language development and adoption point to Python as the high-level systems integration language of choice. Python leverages a vast developer-base external to the neuroscience community, and promises leaps in simulation complexity and maintainability to any neural simulator that adopts it. PyNN http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN strives to provide a uniform application programming interface (API) across neural simulators. Presently NEURON and NEST are supported, and support for other simulators and neuromorphic VLSI hardware is under development. With PyNN it is possible to write a simulation script once and run it without modification on any supported simulator. It is also possible to write a script that uses capabilities specific to a single simulator. While this sacrifices simulator-independence, it adds flexibility, and can be a useful step in porting models between simulators. The design goals of PyNN include allowing access to low-level details of a simulation where necessary, while providing the capability to model at a high level of abstraction, with concomitant gains in development speed and simulation maintainability. Another of our aims with PyNN is to increase the productivity of neuroscience modeling, by making it faster to develop models de novo, by promoting code sharing and reuse across simulator communities, and by making it much easier to debug, test and validate simulations by running them on more than one simulator. Modelers would then become free to devote more software development effort to innovation, building on the simulator core with new tools such as network topology databases, stimulus programming, analysis and visualization tools, and simulation accounting. The resulting, community-developed 'meta-simulator' system would then represent a powerful tool for overcoming the so-called complexity bottleneck that is presently a major roadblock for neural modeling.},

@article{Davison08,
    abstract = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization and data-management tools. PyNN increases the reliability of modelling studies by making it much easier to check results on multiple simulators.

    abstract = {Low-level perceptual computations may be understood in terms of efficient codes (Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001, Annual Review of Neuroscience 24 1193-216). Following this argument, we explore models of representation for natural static images as a way to understand the processing of information in the primary visual cortex. This representation is here based on a generative linear model of the synthesis of images using an over-complete multi-resolution dictionary of edges. This transform is implemented using log-Gabor filters and permits an exact reconstruction of any image. However, this linear representation is redundant and since to any image may correspond different representations, we explore more efficient representations of the image. The problem is stated as an ill-posed inverse problem and we compare first different known strategies by computing the efficiency of the solutions given by Matching Pursuit (Perrinet, 2004, IEEE Trans. Neural Networks 15 1164-75) and sparse edge coding (Fischer, in press, Trans. Image Processing) with classical representation methods such as JPEG. This comparison allows us to provide a synthesized approach using a probabilistic representation which would progressively construct the neural representation by using lateral cooperations. We propose an algorithm which dynamically diffuses information to correlated filters so as to yield a progressively disambiguated representation. This approach takes advantage of the computational properties of spiking neurons such as Integrate-and-Fire neurons and provides an efficient yet simple model for the representation of natural images. This representation is directly linked with the edge content of natural images and we show applications of this method to edge extraction, denoising and compression. We also show that this dynamical approach fits with neuro-physiological observations and may explain the non-linear interactions between neighboring neurons which may be observed in the cortex.},

    abstract = {Meanwhile biorthogonal wavelets got a very popular image processing tool, alternative multiresolution transforms have been proposed for solving some of their drawbacks, namely the poor selectivity in orientation and the lack of translation in- variance due to the aliasing between subbands. These transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. At the same time their optimization get a challenging task. We proposed here a log-Gabor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the Gabor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. Two major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. And second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). The transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. Compared to the state of the art, the log-Gabor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent Gaussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. Such characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.},

@article{Fleuriet11,
    abstract = {When generating a saccade toward a moving target, the target displacement that occurs during the period spanning from its detection to the saccade end must be taken into account to accurately foveate the target and to initiate its pursuit. Previous studies have shown that these saccades are characterized by a lower peak velocity and a prolonged deceleration phase. In some cases, a second peak eye velocity appears during the deceleration phase, presumably reflecting the late influence of a mechanism that compensates for the target displacement occurring before saccade end. The goal of this work was to further determine in the head restrained monkey the dynamics of this putative compensatory mechanism. A step-ramp paradigm, where the target motion was orthogonal to a target step occurring along the primary axes, was used to estimate from the generated saccades: a component induced by the target step and another one induced by the target motion. Resulting oblique saccades were compared with saccades to a static target with matched horizontal and vertical amplitudes. This study permitted to estimate the time taken for visual motion-related signals to update the programming and execution of saccades. The amplitude of the motion-related component was slightly hypometric with an undershoot that increased with target speed. Moreover, it matched with the eccentricity that the target had 40-60 ms before saccade end. The lack of significant difference in the delay between the onsets of the horizontal and vertical components between saccades directed toward a static target and those aimed at a moving target questions the late influence of the compensatory mechanism. The results are discussed within the framework of the d̈ual drive\änd m̈̈apping\p̈̈otheses.},

It is widely assumed that visual processing follows a forward sequence of processing steps along a hierarchy of laminar sub-populations of the neural system. Taking the example of the early visual system of mammals, most models are consequently organized in layers from the retina to visual cortical areas, until a decision is taken using the representation that is formed in the highest layer. Typically, features of higher complexity (position, orientation, size, curvature, ...) are successively extracted in distinct layers (Carandini, 2012). This is prevalent in most deep learning algorithms and stems from a long history of feed-forward architectures. Though this proved to be highly successful, the origin of such architectures is not known i̧teSerre07. Using a generic unsupervised learning algorithm, we first trained a simple one-layer convolutional neural network on a seta of natural images with a growing number of neurons. By doing this, we could quantitatively manipulate the complexity of the representation that emerges from such learning and analyze if sub-populations within the layer could be grouped by their similarity, hence justifying the emergence of a hierarchical processing. As shown in previous studies (Olshausen, 1996), such an algorithm converges to a weight matrix that has strong analogies with the receptive fields of simple cells located in the Primary Visual Cortex of mammals (V1).

This result extends naturally to a cortical representation of the input image that encodes second-order features (edges) as neural responses arranged in a three-dimensional space, where the third dimension can be seen as a model of hyper-columns of the Primary Visual Cortex. From this bio-inspired encoding, we were able to define contours in images as simple smooth trajectories in a cortical representation space. This simple model shows that hierarchical processing may originate from the neural encoding of different visual transformations within natural images: respectively translation, rotations and zooms, which correspond to rigid translation in the cortical space. The model can be further extended to reproduce the effect of complex cells in V1 (max pooling) and feedback signals from higher cortical areas.
We predict that invariance to more complex transformation like shearing (perspective) and viewpoint changes (looming) will emerge as these additional steps in sensory processing are taken into account.

Indeed, a higher level of complexity can be introduced as the cortical representation is extended from smooth trajectories (space domain) to smooth surfaces (space-time domain). As such, this justifies the extension of a simple sparse network formalism to translation invariant neural networks (such as the convolutional neural networks used in deep learning) that is able to generalize geometrical transformations, such as translation, rotations, and zooms, in an invariant bio-inspired representation ([[https://github.com/bicv/SparseEdges|Perrinet, 2015]]). This should provide some key insights into higher-order features such as co-occurrences, but also to novel categorization architectures. Indeed, such features were recently found to be sufficient to allow the categorization of images containing an animal ([[Publications/PerrinetBednar15|Perrinet & Bednar, 2015]]). Crucially, as the geometrical transformations develop in time, we expect that the detection of these features is made robust by dynamical processes.},

    abstract = {If perception corresponds to hypothesis testing (Gregory, 1980); then visual searches might be construed as experiments that generate sensory data. In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.},

    abstract = {Predictive coding hypothesizes that the brain explicitly infers upcoming sensory input to establish a coherent representation of the world. Although it is becoming generally accepted, it is not clear on which level spiking neural networks may implement predictive coding and what function their connectivity may have. We present a network model of conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons inspired by the architecture of retinotopic cortical areas that assumes predictive coding is implemented through network connectivity, namely in the connection delays and in selectiveness for the tuning properties of source and target cells. We show that the applied connection pattern leads to motion-based prediction in an experiment tracking a moving dot. In contrast to our proposed model, a network with random or isotropic connectivity fails to predict the path when the moving dot disappears. Furthermore, we show that a simple linear decoding approach is sufficient to transform neuronal spiking activity into a probabilistic estimate for reading out the target trajectory.},

    abstract = {As it is confronted to inherent neural delays, how does the visual system create a coherent representation of a rapidly changing environment? In this paper, we investigate the role of motion-based prediction in estimating motion trajectories compensating for delayed information sampling. In particular, we investigate how anisotropic diffusion of information may explain the development of anticipatory response as recorded in a neural populations to an approaching stimulus. We validate this using an abstract probabilistic framework and a spiking neural network (SNN) model. Inspired by a mechanism proposed by Nijhawan [1], we first use a Bayesian particle filter framework and introduce a diagonal motion-based prediction model which extrapolates the estimated response to a delayed stimulus in the direction of the trajectory. In the SNN implementation, we have used this pattern of anisotropic, recurrent connections between excitatory cells as mechanism for motion-extrapolation. Consistent with recent experimental data collected in extracellular recordings of macaque primary visual cortex [2], we have simulated different trajectory lengths and have explored how anticipatory responses may be dependent on the information accumulated along the trajectory. We show that both our probabilistic framework and the SNN model can replicate the experimental data qualitatively. Most importantly, we highlight requirements for the development of a trajectory-dependent anticipatory response, and in particular the anisotropic nature of the connectivity pattern which leads to the motion extrapolation mechanism.},

@article{Khoei13jpp,
    abstract = {During normal viewing, the continuous stream of visual input is regularly interrupted, for instance by blinks of the eye. Despite these frequents blanks (that is the transient absence of a raw sensory source), the visual system is most often able to maintain a continuous representation of motion. For instance, it maintains the movement of the eye such as to stabilize the image of an object. This ability suggests the existence of a generic neural mechanism of motion extrapolation to deal with fragmented inputs. In this paper, we have modeled how the visual system may extrapolate the trajectory of an object during a blank using motion-based prediction. This implies that using a prior on the coherency of motion, the system may integrate previous motion information even in the absence of a stimulus. In order to compare with experimental results, we simulated tracking velocity responses. We found that the response of the motion integration process to a blanked trajectory pauses at the onset of the blank, but that it quickly recovers the information on the trajectory after reappearance. This is compatible with behavioral and neural observations on motion extrapolation. To understand these mechanisms, we have recorded the response of the model to a noisy stimulus. Crucially, we found that motion-based prediction acted at the global level as a gain control mechanism and that we could switch from a smooth regime to a binary tracking behavior where the dot is tracked or lost. Our results imply that a local prior implementing motion-based prediction is sufficient to explain a large range of neural and behavioral results at a more global level. We show that the tracking behavior deteriorates for sensory noise levels higher than a certain value, where motion coherency and predictability fail to hold longer. In particular, we found that motion-based prediction leads to the emergence of a tracking behavior only when enough information from the trajectory has been accumulated. Then, during tracking, trajectory estimation is robust to blanks even in the presence of relatively high levels of noise. Moreover, we found that tracking is necessary for motion extrapolation, this calls for further experimental work exploring the role of noise in motion extrapolation.},

    abstract = {The flash lag effect (FLE) is a well known visual illusion that reveals the perceptual difference in position coding of moving and stationary flashed objects. It has been reproduced experimentally in retina and V1 along with some relevant evidences about motion based position coding in areas MT and MT+. Numerous hypotheses for mechanisms underlying FLE such as motion extrapolation, latency difference, position persistence, temporal averaging and postdiction have been under debate for last two decades. Here, we have challenged our previous motion-based prediction model to understand FLE, consistently with the motion extrapolation account proposed by Nijhawan. Our hypothesis is based on predictability of motion trajectory and importance of motion signal in manipulation of receptive field shape for moving objects. Using a probabilistic framework, we have implemented motion-based prediction (MBP) and simulated three different demonstrations of FLE including standard, flash initiated and flash terminated cycles. This method allowed us to compare the shape of the characteristic receptive fields for moving and stationary flashed dots in the case of rightward and leftward motions. As control model, we have eliminated velocity signal from motion estimation and simulated position-based (PX) model of FLE. Results of MBP model suggest that above a minimal time for duration of flash, the development of predictive component for the moving object is sufficient to shift in the direction of motion and to produce flash lag effect. MBP model reproduces experimental data of FLE and its dependence to the contrast of flash. Against what has been argued as shortage of motion extrapolation account, in our results spatial lead of moving object is also evident in flash initiated cycle. Our model, without being restricted to one special visual area, provides a generic account for FLE by emphasize on different manipulation of stationary objects and trajectory motion by the sensory system.},

    abstract = {Due to its inherent neural delays, the visual system has an outdated access to sensory information about the current position of moving objects. In contrast, living organisms are remarkably able to track and intercept moving objects under a large range of challenging environmental conditions. Physiological, behavioral and psychophysical evidences strongly suggest that position coding is extrapolated using an explicit and reliable representation of object's motion but it is still unclear how these two representations interact. For instance, the so-called flash-lag effect supports the idea of a differential processing of position between moving and static objects. Although elucidating such mechanisms is crucial in our understanding of the dynamics of visual processing, a theory is still missing to explain the different facets of this visual illusion. Here, we reconsider several of the key aspects of the flash-lag effect in order to explore the role of motion upon neural coding of objects' position. First, we formalize the problem using a Bayesian modeling framework which includes a graded representation of the degree of belief about visual motion. We introduce a motion-based prediction model as a candidate explanation for the perception of coherent motion. By including the knowledge of a fixed delay, we can model the dynamics of sensory information integration by extrapolating the information acquired at previous instants in time. Next, we simulate the optimal estimation of object position with and without delay compensation and compared it with human perception under a broad range of different psychophysical conditions. Our computational study suggests that the explicit, probabilistic representation of velocity information is crucial in explaining position coding, and therefore the flash-lag effect. We discuss these theoretical results in light of the putative corrective mechanisms that can be used to cancel out the detrimental effects of neural delays and illuminate the more general question of the dynamical representation of spatial information at the present time in the visual pathways.},

    abstract = {Sensory input enters the cortex via the thalamocortical (TC) projection, where it elicits large postsynaptic potentials in layer 4 neurons [1]. Interestingly, the TC connections account for only ̃15% of synapses onto these neurons. It has been therefore controversially discussed how thalamic input can drive the cortex. Strong TC synapses have been one suggestion to ensure the strength of the TC projection (s̈trong-synapse model̈̇ Another possibility is that the excitation from single thalamic fibers are weak but get amplified by recurrent excitatory feedback in layer 4 (p̈̈lifier model\B̈̈runo and Sakmann [2] recently provided new evidence that individual TC synapses in vivo are weak and only produce small excitatory postsynaptic potentials. However, they suggested that thalamic input can activate the cortex due to the synchronous firing and that cortical amplification is not required. This would support the ̈̈\ö̈ny models̈̈̈ed by correlation analysis [3]. Here, we studied the effect of correlation in the TC input, with weak synapses, to the responses of a layered cortical network model. The connectivity of the layered network was taken from Binzegger et al. 2004 [4]. The network was simulated using NEST [5] with the Python interface PyNN [6] to enable interoperability with different simulators. The sensory input to layer 4 was modelled by a simple retino-geniculate model of the transformation of light into spike trains [7], which was implemented by leaky integrate-and-fire model neurons. We found that introducing correlation into TC inputs enhanced the likelihood to produce responses in layer 4 and improved the activity propagation across layers. In addition, we compared the response of the cortical network to different noise conditions and obtained contrast response functions which were in accordance with neurophysiological observations.

A common model for simple-cell computation in layer 4 is the ``push-pull'' circuitry (Troyer et al. 1998). It accounts for the observed anti-phase behaviour between excitatory and inhibitory conductances in response to a drifting grating (Anderson et al., 2000; Monier et al., 2008), creating a wide temporal integration window during which excitation is integrated without the shunting or opponent effect of inhibition and allowed to elicit multiple spikes. This is in contrast to recent results from intracellular recordings in vivo during presentation of natural scenes (Baudot et al., submitted). Here the excitatory and inhibitory conductances were highly correlated, with inhibition lagging excitation only by few milliseconds (̃6 ms). This small lag creates a narrow temporal integration window such that only synchronized excitatory inputs can elicit a spike, similar to parallel observations in other cortical sensory areas (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Okun and Lampl, 2008). To investigate the cellular and network mechanisms underlying these two different correlation structures, we constructed a realistic model of the V1 network using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses. We calibrated our model to fit the irregular ongoing activity pattern as well as in vivo conductance measurements during drifting grating stimulation and then extracted predicted responses to natural scenes seen through eye-movements. Our simulations reproduced the above described experimental observation, together with anti-phase behaviour between excitation and inhibition during gratings and phase lagged activation during natural scenes. In conclusion, the same cortical network that shows dense and variable responses to gratings exhibits sparse and precise spiking to natural scenes. Work is under way to show to which extent this feature is specific for the feedforward vs recurrent nature of the modelled circuit.},

    abstract = {Neurons receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs whose temporal interplay determines their spiking behavior. On average, excitation (Gexc) and inhibition (Ginh) balance each other, such that spikes are elicited by fluctuations [1]. In addition, it has been shown in vivo that Gexc and Ginh are correlated, with Ginh lagging Gexc only by few milliseconds (6ms), creating a small temporal integration window [2,3]. This correlation structure could be induced by feed-forward inhibition (FFI), which has been shown to be present at many sites in the central nervous system. To characterize the functional consequences of the FFI, we first modeled a simple circuit using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses and studied the effect on the single neuron integration. We then coupled many of such circuits to construct a feed-forward network (synfire chain [4,5]) and investigated the effect of FFI on signal propagation along such feed-forward network. We found that the small temporal integration window, induced by the FFI, changes the integrative properties of the neuron. Only transient stimuli could produce a response when the FFI was active whereas without FFI the neuron responded to both steady and transient stimuli. Due to the increase in selectivity to transient inputs, the conditions of signal propagation through the feed-forward network changed as well. Whereas synchronous inputs could reliable propagate, high asynchronous input rates, which are known to induce synfire activity [6], failed to do so. In summary, the FFI increased the stability of the synfire chain. Supported by DFG SFB 780, EU-15879-FACETS, BMBF 01GQ0420 to BCCN Freiburg [1] Kumar A., Schrader S., Aertsen A. and Rotter S. (2008).

By contrast, natural scenes are encoded more efficiently by sparse and temporal precise spiking responses. We used a conductance-based model of the visual system in higher mammals to investigate how two specific features of the thalamo-cortical pathway, namely push-pull receptive field organization and synaptic depression, can contribute to this contextual reshaping of V1 responses. By comparing cortical dynamics evoked respectively by natural vs. artificial stimuli in a comprehensive parametric space analysis, we demonstrate that the reliability and sparseness of the spiking responses during natural vision is not a mere consequence of the increased bandwidth in the sensory input spectrum. Rather, it results from the combined impacts of synaptic depression and push-pull inhibition, the later acting for natural scenes as a form of ``effective'' feed-forward inhibition as demonstrated in other sensory systems. Thus, the combination of feedforward-like inhibition with fast thalamo-cortical synaptic depression by simple cells receiving a direct structured input from thalamus composes a generic computational mechanism for generating a sparse and reliable encoding of natural sensory events.},

    abstract = {The selectivity of the visual system to oriented patterns is very well documented in a wide range of species, especially in mammals. In particular, neurons of the primary visual cortex are anatomically grouped by their preference to a given oriented visual stimulus. Interactions between such groups of neurons have been successfully modeled using recurrently-connected network of spiking neurons, so called "ring models". Nonetheless, this selectivity is most often studied with crystal-like patterns such as gratings. Here, we studied the ability of human observers to discriminate texture-like patterns for which we could quantitatively tune the precision of their oriented content and we propose a generic model to explain such results. The first contribution shows that the discrimination threshold as a function of the precision did not vary smoothly as would be expected, but more in a binary, "all or none" fashion. Our second contribution is to propose a novel model of orientation selectivity that is based on deep-learning techniques, which performance we evaluated in the same task. This model has human-like performance in term of accuracy and exhibits qualitatively similar psychophysical curves. One hypothesis that such a structure allows for the system to be robust to noise in its visual inputs.},

The properties of motion processing for driving smooth eye movements have bee investigated using simple, artificial stimuli such as gratings, small dots or random dot patterns. Motion processing in the context of complex, natural images is less known. We have previously investigated the human ocular following responses to a novel class of random texture stimuli of parameterized naturalistic statistics: the Motion Clouds. In Fourier space, these dynamical textures are designed with a log normal distribution of spatial frequencies power multiplied by a pink noise power spectral density that reduces the high frequency contents of the stimulus (Sanz-Leon et al. 2011). We have previously shown that the precision of reflexive tracking increases with the spatial frequency bandwidth of large (> 30◦ diameter) patterns (i.e. the width of the spatial frequency distribution around a given mean spatial frequency; Simoncini et al. 2012). Now, we extend this approach to voluntary tracking and focused on the effects of spatial frequency bandwidth upon the initial phase of smooth pursuit eye movements. Participants were instructed to pursue a large patch of moving clouds (mean speeds: 5, 10 or 20◦/s) embedded within a smoothing Gaussian window of standard deviation 5◦. The motion stimuli were presented with four different spatial frequency band- widths and two different mean spatial frequencies (0.3 and 1 cpd). We observed that smaller bandwidth textures exhibit a stronger spectral energy within the low spatial frequency range (below 1cpd), yielding to shorter latency of smooth pursuit eye movements. A weak and less consistent effect was found on initial eye acceleration, contrary what was previously observed with OFR. After 400ms, the steady-state tracking velocity matched the mean visual motion speed and pursuit performance was comparable with that observed with a control, small dot motion. Motion Clouds offer an efficient tool to probe the optimal window of visibility for human smooth pursuit through the manipulation of both the mean and the variability of spatial frequency.},

    abstract = {It is still not fully understood how visual system integrates motion energy across different spatial and temporal frequencies to build a coherent percept of the global motion under the complex, noisy naturalistic conditions. We addressed this question by manipulating local speed variability distribution (i. e. speed bandwidth) using a well-controlled class of broadband random-texture stimuli called Motion Clouds (MCs) with continuous naturalistic spatiotemporal frequency spectra (Sanz-Leon et al., 2012, ; Simoncini et al., 2012). In a first 2AFC experiment on speed discrimination, participants had to compare the speed of a broad speed bandwidth MC (range: 0.05-8$\,^∘$/s) moving at 1 of 5 possible mean speeds (ranging from 5 to 13 $\,^∘$/s) to that of another MC with a small speed bandwidth (SD: 0.05 $\,^∘$/s), always moving at a mean speed of 10$\,^∘$/s . We found that MCs with larger speed bandwidth (between 0.05-0.5$\,^∘$/s) were perceived moving faster. Within this range, speed uncertainty results in over-estimating stimulus velocity. However, beyond a critical bandwidth (SD: 0.5 $\,^∘$/s), perception of a coherent speed was lost. In a second 2AFC experiment on direction discrimination, participants had to estimate the motion direction of moving MCs with different speed bandwidths. We found that for large band MCs participant could no longer discriminate motion direction. These results suggest that when increasing speed bandwidth from small to large range, the observer experiences different perceptual regimes. We then decided to run a Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (Knoblauch & Maloney, 2008) experiment with our speed bandwidth stimuli to investigate these different possible perceptual regimes. We identified three regimes within this space that correspond to motion coherency, motion transparency and motion incoherency. These results allow to further characterize the shape of the interactions kernel observed between different speed tuned channels and different spatiotemporal scales (Gekas et al ., 2017) that underlies global velocity estimation.},

    abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to psychophysics and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independently of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad-hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This simpler solution may give insights in the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.},

    abstract = {Humans are able to interact successfully with moving objects in our dynamic world and the visual system effi ciently performs the motion computation that makes this possible. Object speed and direction are estimated following the integration of information across cortical motion sensitive channels. Speed estimation along this system is not fully understood, particularly the mapping function between the actual speed of viewed objects and that perceived by observers, a question we address in this work. It has been demonstrated that perceived speed is profoundly influenced by object contrast, spatial frequency, stimulus complexity and frequency bandwidth. In a 2 interval forced choice speed discrimination task, we present a random phase textured motion stimulus to probe small shifts in perceived speed measured using fi xed stimulus sets as reference scales while mean spatial frequency and bandwidths serve as the dependent variable in a probe. The presentations are short (200ms). Using a scale of narrowband stimuli (0.2 octaves), we measured a shift in perceived speed; higher frequencies are seen as faster moving than lower ones. On the scale of broader bandwidth (1 octave), this difference across frequency was reduced and perceived speed seems to converge on a slower representation. From these results we estimated this mapping between perceived and veridical stimulus speeds. In direct comparisons, the relative speed is faster for high frequencies and increases in bandwidth make stimuli appear slower. During this early computation, when presented with a random phase stimulus it appears that the visual systems makes assumptions about expected speeds based on the richness of the frequency content and the veridical speed is not explicitly computed.

    abstract = {Estimating object speed in visual scenes is a critical part of perception. While various aspects of speed computation including discrimination thresholds, neural mechanisms and spatial integration mechanisms have been studied, there remain areas to elucidate. One is the integration of information across spatio-temporal frequency channels to compute speed. We probe this integration with a 2-AFC psychophysical task in which moving random phase noise stimuli are used with experimenter defined frequency parameters and bandwidths to target specific neural populations. They are presented for 300ms in a large square aperture with smooth eye movements recorded while speed discrimination judgements are made over two intervals. There is no instruction to observers to pursue the stimuli and no pre trial saccade to induce a classic ocular following response. After a latency, eye movements follow the stimulated direction presumably to facilitate the speed judgement. Within each of the two intervals, we randomly vary a range of spatial frequency and speed parameters respectively such that stimuli at the centre of the ranges are identical. The aim is to characterise the speed response of the eye movements recorded in a context which creates an ocular motor 'action' during a perceptual task instead of artificially separating the two. Within the speed varied intervals, averaged eye movements are systematically modulated in strength by stimulus speed. Within the spatial frequency intervals, higher frequencies perceived as faster in discrimination responses interestingly show no corresponding strengthening of eye responses particularly at higher contrasts where they may be weaker. Thus for a pair of stimuli matched for contrast and perceived speed, this early eye response appears to be driven by a contrast dependent low level motion energy like computation. We characterise an underlying spatial frequency response which is shifted towards lower frequencies, unlike the perceptual responses and is probably separate from perception.},

    abstract = {When the visual information about an object's motion differs at the local level, the visuomotor system needs to integrate information across time to solve this ambiguity and converge to the final motion solution. For an oblique line moving horizontally, edge-related motion cues differ from terminator-related information, the latter being coherent with the line's global motion. We have previously shown that ocular tracking of this kind of stimuli is transiently biased toward the edge-orthogonal direction, before converging to the global motion direction. Here, we model the dynamic convergence to the global-motion solution as a recursive update of inferential knowledge in the velocity space. We assume that motion estimation is based on a prior distribution and two independent likelihood functions representing edge-related and terminator-related information. Importantly, the shape of the Bayesian functions is constrained by smooth-pursuit eye-movement data. Model predictions about the dynamic convergence to the correct motion solution are compared to human smooth-pursuit recordings when varying different stimulus parameters (speed, contrast).},

    abstract = {Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that, when the visual information about an object's motion differs on the local (edge-related) and global levels, the local 1D motion cues dominate initially, whereas 2D information takes progressively over and leads to the final correct representation of global motion. Previous models have explained the initial errors (deviations from the global motion) in terms of best perceptual guess in the Bayesian sense. These models accounted for the intrinsic sensory noise of the image and general expectancies for object velocities. Here we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, with the purpose of encompassing the whole dynamical evolution of motion processing, from the 1D cues to the correct global motion. Our model is motivated and constrained by smooth pursuit oculomotor data. Eye movements were recorded in 3 participants using the scleral search coil technique. Participants were asked to track either a single line (vertical or oblique) or a Gaussian blob moving horizontally. In our model, oculomotor data obtained with non ambiguous stimuli (e.g. with coherent local and global information, such as a Gaussian blob or a vertical line moving horizontally) are combined to constrain the initial likelihood and prior functions for the general, ambiguous case (e.g. a tilted line moving horizontally). The prior knowledge is then recursively updated by using the previous posterior probability as the current prior. The idea is that the recursive injection of posterior distribution boosts the spread of information about the object's shape, favoring the integration of 1D and 2D cues. In addition, a simple model of the sensory-oculomotor loop is taken into account, including transmission delays and the evolution of the retinal motion during pursuit. Preliminary results show substantial agreement between the model prediction and the oculomotor data.},

Since low-attenuation areas in HRCT images describe different emphysema patterns, the discrimination problem should focus on the characterization of both local intensities and global spatial variations. We propose a novel texture-based classification framework using complex Gabor filters and local binary patterns. We also analyzed a set of global and local texture descriptors to characterize emphysema morphology. The results have shown the effectiveness of our proposal and that the combination of descriptors provides robust features that lead to an improvement in the classification rate.},

Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combination of saccades and smooth eye  movements.  These  movements  allow  us  to  align  and  stabilize  the  object  on  the  fovea,  thus  enabling  high*resolution  visual  analysis.  When  predictive  information  is  available  about  target  motion,  anticipatory  smooth  pursuit  eye  movements  (aSPEM)  are  efficiently  generated  before  target  appearance,  which  reduce  the  typical  sensorimotor  delay  between  target  motion  onset  and  foveation.  It  is  generally  assumed  that  the  role  of  anticipatory  eye  movements  is  to  limit  the  behavioral  impairment  due  to  eye*to*target  position  and  velocity  mismatch.  By  manipulating  the  probability  for  target  motion  direction  we  were  able  to  bias  the  direction  and  mean  velocity  of  aSPEM, as measured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp*motion onset. This suggests that  probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for  the  initiation  of  anticipatory  movements.  However,  such  estimate  may  become  particularly  challenging  in  a  dynamic  context,  where  the  probabilistic  contingencies  vary  in  time  in  an  unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the information processing underlying the buildup  of  aSPEM  is  linked  to  an  explicit  estimate  of  probabilities  is  unknown.  We  developed  a  new  paired* task  paradigm  in  order  to  address  these  two  questions.  In  a  first  session,  participants  observe  a  target  moving  horizontally  with  constant  speed  from  the  center  either  to  the  right  or  left  across  trials. The probability of either motion direction changes randomly in time. Participants are asked to  estimate "how much they are confident that the target will move to the right or left in the next trial"  and to adjust the cursor's position on the screen accordingly. In a second session the participants eye  movements are recorded during the observation of the same sequence of random*direction trials. In  parallel,  we  are  developing  new  automatic  routines  for  the  advanced  analysis  of  oculomotor  traces.  In  order  to  extract  the  relevant  parameters  of  the  oculomotor  responses  (latency,  gain,  initial  acceleration,  catch*up  saccades),  we  developed  new  tools  based  on  best*fitting  procedure  of  predefined patterns (i.e. the typical smooth pursuit velocity profile).

    abstract = {It is generally assumed that neurons in the central nervous system communicate through temporal firing patterns. As a first step, we will study the learning of a layer of realistic neurons in the particular case where the relevant messages are formed by temporally cor- related patterns, or synfire patterns. The model is a layer of Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neurons with synaptic current dynamics that adapts by minimizing a cost according to a gradient descent scheme. This leads to a rule similar to Spike-Time Dependent Hebbian Plasticity (STDHP). Our results show that the rule that we derive is biologically plausible and leads to the detection of the coherence in the input in an unsupervised way. An application to shape recognition is shown as an illustration.},

    abstract = {A goal of low-level neural processes is to build an efficient code extracting the relevant information from the sensory input. It is believed that this is implemented in cortical areas by elementary inferential computations dynamically extracting the most likely parameters corresponding to the sensory signal. We explore here a neuro-mimetic feed-forward model of the primary visual area (V1) solving this problem in the case where the signal may be described by a robust linear gen- erative model. This model uses an over-complete dictionary of primitives which provides a distributed probabilistic representation of input features. Relying on an efficiency criterion, we derive an algorithm as an approximate solution which uses incremental greedy inference processes. This algorithm is similar to 'Matching Pursuit' and mimics the parallel architecture of neural computations. We propose here a simple implementation using a network of spiking integrate-and-fire neu- rons which communicate using lateral interactions. Numerical simulations show that this Sparse Spike Coding strategy provides an efficient model for representing visual data from a set of natural images. Even though it is simplistic, this trans- formation of spatial data into a spatio-temporal pattern of binary events provides an accurate description of some complex neural patterns observed in the spiking activity of biological neural networks.},

    abstract = {The integration of information is essential to measure the exact 2D motion of a surface from both local ambiguous 1D motion produced by elongated edges and local non-ambiguous 2D motion from features such as corners, end-points or texture elements. The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course which can be read from tracking eye movements: local 1D motion signals are extracted first and then pooled to initiate the ocular responses before that 2D motion signals are taken into account to refine the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these 1D and 2D motion computations is still unclear. Previously, we have shown that the late, 2D-driven response components to either plaids or barber-poles have very similar latencies over a large range of contrast, suggesting a shared mechanism. However, they showed different contrast response functions with these different motion stimuli, suggesting different motion processing. We designed a two-pathways Bayesian model of motion integration and showed that this family of contrast response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of 1D and 2D motion signals for each type of stimulus. Indeed, this formulation may explain contrast response functions that could not be explained by a simple bayesian model (Weiss et al., 2002 em Nature Neuroscience bf 5 , 598--604) and gives a quantitative argument to study how local information with different relative ambiguities values may be pooled to provide an integrated response of the system. Finally, we formulate how different spatial information may be pooled and we draw the analogy of this method with methods using the partial derivative equations. This simple model correctly explains some non-linear interactions between neighboring neurons selective to motion direction which are observed in short-latency ocular following and neuro-physiological data.},

This learning algorithm is in fact based on an efficiency criteria based on the Occam razor: for a similar quality, the shortest representation should be privilegied. This inverse problem is NP-complete and we propose here a greedy solution which is based on the architecture and nature of neural computations (Perrinet, 2006).

    abstract = {Computations in a cortical column are characterized by the dynamical, event-based nature of neuronal signals and are structured by the layered and parallel structure of cortical areas. But they are also characterized by their efficiency in terms of rapidity and robustness. We propose and study here a model of information integration in the primary visual cortex (V1) thanks to the parallel and interconnected network of similar cortical columns. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of contrast gain control mechanisms as a function of the distribution of information relevance in a small population of cortical columns. This cortical area is modeled as a collection of similar cortical columns which receive input and are linked according to a specific connectivity pattern which is relevant to this area. These columns are simulated using the sc Nest simulator Morrison04 using conductance-based Integrate-and-Fire neurons and consist vertically in 3 different layers. The architecture was inspired by neuro-physiological observations on the influence of neighboring activities on pyramidal cells activity and correlates with the lateral flow of information observed in the primary visual cortex, notably in optical imaging experiments Jancke04, and is similar in its final implementation to local micro-circuitry of the cortical column presented by Grossberg05. % They show prototypical spontaneous dynamical behavior to different levels of noise which are relevant to the generic modeling of biological cortical columns Kremkow05. In the future, the connectivity will be derived from an algorithm that was used for modeling the transient spiking response of a layer of neurons to a flashed image and which was based on the Matching Pursuit algorithm Perrinet04. % The visual input is first transmitted from the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) using the model of Gazeres98. It transforms the image flow into a stream of spikes with contrast gain control mechanisms specific to the retina and the LGN. This spiking activity converges to the pyramidal cells of layer 2/3 thanks to the specification of receptive fields in layer 4 providing a preference for oriented local contrasts in the spatio-temporal visual flow. In particular, we use in these experiments visual input organized in a center-surround spatial pattern which was optimized in size to maximize the response of a column in the center and to the modulation of this response by the surround (bipartite stimulus). This class of stimuli provide different levels of input activation and of visual ambiguity in the visual space which were present in the spatio-temporal correlations in the input spike flow optimized to the resolution of cortical columns in the visual space. It thus provides a method to reveal the dynamics of information integration and particularly of contrast gain control which are characteristic to the function of V1.},

Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local 1D motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas 2D information takes pro- gressively over and leads to the final correct represen- tation of global motion. A Bayesian framework ac- counting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of ob- ject motion perception is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particu- larly the time course of its initiation phase. In addi- tion, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of 1D and 2D motion information.},

We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss, Y., Simoncelli, E.P., Adelson, E.H., 2002. Motion illusions as optimal percepts. Nature Neuroscience, 5(6), 598-604, doi:10.1038/nn858] which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to model the OFR for different levels of noise with full field gratings. More recent experiments of OFR have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving OFR, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barthélemy, F.V., Vanzetta, I., Masson, G.S., 2006. Behavioral receptive field for ocular following in humans: dynamics of spatial summation and center-surround interactions. Journal of Neurophysiology, (95), 3712-3726, doi:10.1152/jn.00112.2006]. Herein, we extended the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We present analytical results which show that the hypothesis of independence of local measures can describe the spatial integration of the motion signal. Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the contrast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround.},

    abstract = {We describe the theoretical formulation of a learning algorithm in a model of the primary visual cortex (V1) and present results of the efficiency of this algorithm by comparing it to the SparseNet algorithm [1]. As the SparseNet algorithm, it is based on a model of signal synthesis as a Linear Generative Model but differs in the efficiency criteria for the representation. This learning algorithm is in fact based on an efficiency criteria based on the Occam razor: for a similar quality, the shortest representation should be privileged. This inverse problem is NP-complete and we propose here a greedy solution which is based on the architecture and nature of neural computations [2]). It proposes that the supra-threshold neural activity progressively removes redundancies in the representation based on a correlation-based inhibition and provides a dynamical implementation close to the concept of neural assemblies from Hebb [3]). We present here results of simulation of this network with small natural images (available at http://www.incm.cnrs-mrs.fr/LaurentPerrinet/SparseHebbianLearning) and compare it to the Sparsenet solution. Extending it to realistic images and to the NEST simulator http://www.nest-initiative.org/, we show that this learning algorithm based on the properties of neural computations produces adaptive and efficient representations in V1. 1.

We present in this paper our attempt at outlining the dynamical, parallel and event-based representation for vision in the architecture of the central nervous system. We will illustrate this by showing that in a signal matching framework, a L/LN (linear/non-linear) cascade may efficiently transform a sensory signal into a neural spiking signal and we apply this framework to a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete basis as is necessary for modeling the primary visual cortex: we therefore optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral interactions. We compare the efficiency of this representation in terms of compression as the reconstruction quality as a function of the coding length. This will correspond to a modification of the Matching Pursuit algorithm where the ArgMax function is optimized for competition, or Competition Optimized Matching Pursuit (COMP). We will particularly focus on bridging neuroscience and image processing and on the advantages of such an interdisciplinary approach.},

    abstract = {Short presentation of a large moving pattern elicits an Ocular Following Response (OFR) that exhibits many of the properties attributed to low-level motion processing such as spatial and temporal integration, contrast gain control and divisive interaction between competing motions. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys. More recent experiments of OFR have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the global spatial integration of motion from an intermediate map of possible local translation velocities: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving OFR, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barthelemy06,Barthelemy07]. In fact, the machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensorimotor transformation is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss02] and we extended in the dynamical domain the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We proved that this model is successfully adapted to model the OFR for the different experiments [Perrinet07neurocomp], that is for different levels of noise with full field gratings, with disks of various sizes and also for the effect of a flickering surround. However, another emphad hoc inhibitory mechanism has to be added in this model to account for suppressive effects of the surround. We explore here an hypothesis where this could be understood as the effect of a recurrent prediction of information in the velocity map. In fact, in previous models, the integration step assumes independence of the local information while natural scenes are very predictable: Due to the rigidity and inertia of physical objects in visual space, neighboring local spatiotemporal information is redundant and one may introduce this empha priori knowledge of the statistics of the input in the ideal observer model. We implement this in a realistic model of a layer representing velocities in a map of cortical columns, where predictions are implemented by lateral interactions within the cortical area. First, raw velocities are estimated locally from images and are propagated to this area in a feed-forward manner. Using this velocity map, we progressively learn the dependance of local velocities in a second layer of the model. This algorithm is cyclic since the prediction is using the local velocities which are themselves using both the feed-forward input and the prediction: We control the convergence of this process by measuring results for different learning rate. Results show that this simple model is sufficient to disambiguate characteristic patterns such as the Barber-Pole illusion. Due to the recursive network which is modulating the velocity map, it also explains that the representation may exhibit some memory, such as when an object suddenly disappears or when presenting a dot followed by a line (line-motion illusion). Finally, we applied this model that was tuned over a set of natural scenes to gratings of increasing sizes. We observed first that the feed-forward response as tuned to neurophysiological data gave lower responses at higher eccentricities, and that this effect was greater for higher grating frequencies. Then, we observed that depending on the size of the disk and on its spatial frequency, the recurrent network of lateral interactions Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.},

Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys (see poster of Reynaud et al., VSS09). Based on a previously developed Bayesian framework, we have developed an optimal statistical decoder of such an observed cortical population activity as recorded by optical imaging. This model aims at characterizing the statistical dependence between early neuronal activity and ocular responses and its performance was analyzed by comparing this neuronal read-out and the actual motor responses on a trial-by-trial basis. First, we show that relative performance of the behavioral contrast response function is similar to the best estimate obtained from the neural activity. In particular, we show that the latency of ocular response increases with low contrast conditions as well as with noisier instances of the behavioral task as decoded by the model. Then, we investigate the temporal dynamics of both neuronal and motor responses and show how motion information as represented by the model is integrated in space to improve population decoding over time. Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.

    abstract = {Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism which optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair: By contributing to optimize statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

    abstract = {Oriented edges in images of natural scenes tend to be aligned in collinear or co-circular arrangements, with lines and smooth curves more common than other possible arrangements of edges (Geisler et al., Vis Res 41:711-24, 2001). The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an ässociation field\(̈Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a more general edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse coding to avoid multiple responses to a single edge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for natural images replicated qualitatively the results from Geisler et al. (2001), confirming that prior information about continuations appeared consistently in natural images. However, we find that the largely man-made environment in which these animals were reared has a significantly higher probability of collinear edge elements. We thus predict that if the lateral connection patterns are due to visual experience, the patterns in wild-raised tree shrews would be very different from those measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with shorter-range correlations and less emphasis on collinear continuations. This prediction can be tested in future experiments on matching groups of animals reared in different environments. W.H. Bosking and Y. Zhang and B. Schofield and D.

Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filter- ing to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalised coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalised coordinates provides a simple means of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. This compensation is illustrated us- ing neuronal simulations of oculomotor following responses with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the generative model that produces ocular following to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements --- in which the system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted by a (fictive) point moving in the visual field.

    abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to psychophysics and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independently of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad-hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This simpler solution may give insights in the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.},

    abstract = {The representation of images in the brain is known to be sparse. That is, as neural activity is recorded in a visual area ---for instance the primary visual cortex of primates--- only a few neurons are active at a given time with respect to the whole population. It is believed that such a property reflects the efficient match of the representation with the statistics of natural scenes. Applying such a paradigm to computer vision therefore seems a promising approach towards more biomimetic algorithms. Herein, we will describe a biologically-inspired approach to this problem. First, we will describe an unsupervised learning paradigm which is particularly adapted to the efficient coding of image patches. Then, we will outline a complete multi-scale framework ---SparseLets--- implementing a biologically inspired sparse representation of natural images. Finally, we will propose novel methods for integrating prior information into these algorithms and provide some preliminary experimental results. We will conclude by giving some perspective on applying such algorithms to computer vision. More specifically, we will propose that bio-inspired approaches may be applied to computer vision using predictive coding schemes, sparse models being one simple and efficient instance of such schemes.},

In particular, a prominent facet of this structure is that images can be described by a relatively sparse number of features. We designed a sparse coding algorithm biologically-inspired by the architecture of the primary visual cortex. We show here that coefficients of this representation exhibit a power-law distribution. For each image, the exponent of this distribution characterizes sparseness and varies from image to image. To investigate the role of this sparseness, we designed a new class of random textured stimuli with a controlled sparseness value inspired by measurements of natural images. Then, we provide with a method to synthesize random textures images with a given sparseness statistics that match that of some class of natural images and provide perspectives for their use in neurophysiology.},

Dans l'installation «Tropique», des faisceaux de lames lumineuses sont arrangés dans l'espace assombri de l'installation. Les spectateurs les observent grâce à leur interaction avec une brume invisible qui est diffusée dans l'espace. Dans «Trame Élasticité», 25 parallélépipèdes de miroirs (3m de haut) sont arrangés verticalement sur une ligne horizontale. Ces lames sont rotatives et leurs mouvements est synchronisé. Suivant la dyamique qui est imposé à ces lames, la perception de l'espace environnent fluctue conduisant à recomposer l'espace de la concentration à l'expansion, ou encore à générer un surface semblant transparente ou inverser la visons de ce qui est située devant et derrière l'observateur.

    abstract = {Recording eye movements is a technique that attracts an increasing number of scientists, but also in the general public. Indeed, this allows to quantitatively measure a number of useful dimensions of perception and behavior in general. However, most existing trackers rely on expensive or technically complex solutions. Here, we propose a simple framework to record eye movements using any camera, such as a webcam. As a proof of concept, the recorded image is processed in real-time to detect from a simple sub-set of eye movements : left, center, right or blink. The processing is based on two stages. First, we use a pre-trained computer vision algorithm to extract the image of the face. Second, we used a classical deep-learning architecture to learn to classify these sub-images. This network is a 3 layered convolutional neural network, for which we optimized performance as measured by the accuracy with cross-validation on a wide range of the network's hyper-parameters. Over a dataset of more than 1000 images, this network achieves an average accuracy of approximately 97%. We also provide with an integration with the psychopy library which shows that frames can be processed on a standard laptop at a rate of approximately 25Hz.},

    abstract = {Analysis and interpretation of a visual scene to extract its category, such as whether it contains an animal, is typically assumed to involve higher-level associative brain areas. Previous proposals have been based on a series of processing steps organized in a multi-level hierarchy that would progressively analyze the scene at increasing levels of abstraction, from contour extraction to low-level object recognition and finally to object categorization (Serre, PNAS 2007). We explore here an alternative hypothesis that the statistics of edge co-occurences are sufficient to perform a rough yet robust (translation, scale, and rotation invariant) scene categorization. The method is based on a realistic model of image analysis in the primary visual cortex that extends previous work from Geisler et al. (Vis. Res. 2001). Using a scale-space analysis coupled with a sparse coding algorithm, we achieved detailed and robust extraction of edges in different sets of natural images. This edge-based representation allows for a simple characterization of the ``association field'' of edges by computing the statistics of co-occurrences. We show that the geometry of angles made between edges is sufficient to distinguish between different sets of natural images taken in a variety of environments (natural, man-made, or containing an animal). Specifically, a simple classifier, working solely on the basis of this geometry, gives performance similar to that of hierarchical models and of humans in rapid-categorization tasks. Such results call attention to the importance of the relative geometry of local image patches in visual computation, with implications for designing efficient image analysis systems. Most importantly, they challenge assumptions about the flow of computations in the visual system and emphasize the relative importance in this process of associative connections, and in particular of intra-areal lateral connections.},

Here we show that the statistics of edge co-occurrences alone are sufficient to perform a rough yet robust (translation, scale, and rotation invariant) scene categorization. We first extracted the edges from images using a scale-space analysis coupled with a sparse coding algorithm. We then computed the ``association field'' for different categories (natural, man-made, or containing an animal) by computing the statistics of edge co-occurrences. These differed strongly, with animal images having more curved configurations. We show that this geometry alone is sufficient for categorization, and that the pattern of errors made by humans is consistent with this procedure. Because these statistics could be measured as early as the primary visual cortex, the results challenge widely held assumptions about the flow of computations in the visual system. The results also suggest new algorithms for image classification and signal processing that exploit correlations between low-level structure and the underlying semantic category.},

    abstract = {Motion detection represents one of the critical tasks of the visual system and has motivated a large body of research. However, it remains unclear precisely why the response of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to simple artificial stimuli does not predict their response to complex, naturalistic stimuli. To explore this topic, we use Motion Clouds (MC), which are synthetic textures that preserve properties of natural images and are merely parameterized, in particular by modulating the spatiotemporal spectrum complexity of the stimulus by adjusting the frequency bandwidths. By stimulating the retina of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus with MC we show that the RGCs respond to increasingly complex stimuli by narrowing their adjustment curves in response to movement. At the level of the population, complex stimuli produce a sparser code while preserving movement information; therefore, the stimuli are encoded more efficiently. Interestingly, these properties were observed throughout different populations of RGCs. Thus, our results reveal that the response at the level of RGCs is modulated by the naturalness of the stimulus - in particular for motion - which suggests that the tuning to the statistics of natural images already emerges at the level of the retina.},

@inproceedings{Redondo05,
    abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of simple cortical cells as 1) a linear transform representing edges and 2) a non-linear iterative stage of inhibition and facilitation between neighboring coefficients. The linear transform is a complex log-Gabor wavelet transform which is overcomplete (i.e. there are more coefficients than pixels in the image) and has exact reconstruction. The inhibition consists in diminishing down the coefficients which are not at a local-maxima along the direction normal to the edge filter orientation, whereas the facilitation enhances the collinear and co-aligned local-maximum coefficients. At each iteration and after the inhibition and facilitation stages, the reconstructed error is subtracted in the transform domain for keeping an exact reconstruction. Such process concentrates the signal energy on a few coefficients situated along the edges of the objects, yielding a sparse representation. The rationale for such procedure is: (1) th e overcompleteness offers flexibility for activity reassignment; (2) images can be coded by sparse Gabor coefficients located on object edges; (3) image contours produce aligned and collinear local-maxima in the transform domain; (4) the inhibition/facilitation processes are able to extract the contours. The sparse Gabor coefficients are mostly connected each other and located along object contours. Such layout makes chain coding suitable for compression purposes. Specially adapted to Gabor wavelets features, our chain coding represents every chain by its end-points (head and tail) and the elementary movements necessary to walk along the chain from head to tail. Moreover it predicts the module and phase of each Gabor coefficient according to the previous chain coefficient. As a result, redundancy of the transform domain is further reduced. Used for compression, the scheme limits particularly the high-frequency artifacts. The model performs also efficiently in tasks the Human Visual System is supposed to deal with, as for instance edge extraction and image denoising.},

These stimuli are defined using a generative model that is based on controlled experimental parametrization. We show that Motion Clouds correspond to dense mixing of localized moving gratings with random positions. Their global envelope is similar to natural-like stimulation with an approximate full-field translation corresponding to a retinal slip. We describe the construction of these stimuli mathematically and propose an open-source Python-based implementation. Examples of the use of this framework are shown.

We used rich textured motion stimuli of varying bandwidths to decipher how the human visual motion system computes object speed in different behavioral contexts. We found that, although a simple visuomotor behavior such as short-latency ocular following responses takes advantage of the full distribution of motion signals, perceptual speed discrimination is impaired for stimuli with large bandwidths.

    abstract = {To measure speed and direction of moving objects, the cortical motion system pools information across different spatiotemporal channels. One yet unsolved question is to understand how the brain pools this information and whether this pooling is generic or adaptive at the behavioral contexts. Here, we investigate in humans this integration process for two different tasks: psychophysical speed discrimination and ocular following eye movements, which are a probe of early motion detection and integration (Masson & Perrinet, 2011). For both tasks, we used short presentations of ``moving textures'' stimuli (Schrater et al., 2000) in which the width of the spatial frequency distribution (Bsf) was varied. We found that larger Bsf elicited stronger initial eye velocity during the open-loop part of tracking responses. Moreover, richer stimuli resulted in more accurate and reliable motor responses. By contrast, larger Bsf had a detrimental effect upon speed discrimination performance: speed discrimination thresholds linearly decreased when the width of spatial frequency distribution increased. These opposite results can be explained by a different decoding strategy where speed information is under the control of different gain setting mechanisms. We tested this model by measuring contrast response functions of both ocular following and speed discrimination for each Bsf. We found that varying spatial frequency distribution had opposite effect upon contrast gain control. Increasing Bsf lowered half-saturation contrast for ocular following but increased it for perception. Our results supports the view that speed-based perception and tracking eye movements are under the control of different early decoding mechanism. References Masson, G.S. & Perrinet, L.U.

It is unclear how the spatiotemporal content of the fixated scene has an impact on the properties of miniatures, fixational eye movements. We have investigated the characteristics of fixational eye movements recorded while human subjects are instructed to fixate natural statistics random textures (Motion Clouds) in which we manipulated the spatial frequency content. We used long presentations (5 sec) of Motion Clouds stimuli (Schrater et al. 2000) of varying spatial frequency bandwidths (Bsf) around different central spatial frequency (Sf0). We found that central spatial frequency has an effect upon microsaccadic eye movements. In particular, smaller saccadic amplitudes were associated with high spatial frequencies, and larger saccades with low spatial frequencies. Broadening the spatial frequency bandwidth also changed the distribution of microsaccade amplitudes. A lower spatial frequencies, larger Bsf resulted in a large reduction of microsaccades amplitude while fixation behavior for high spatial frequencies texture was not affected. Relationship between microsaccade rate and intersaccadic timing was also dependent upon Bsf. These results suggest that the spatial frequency content of the fixated images have a strong impact upon fixation instability.},

    abstract = {The visual system does not process information instantaneously, but rather integrates over time. Integration occurs both for stationary objects and moving objects, with very similar time constants (Burr, 1981). We measured, as a function of exposure duration, speed discrimination and ocular following performance for rich textured motion stimuli of varying spatial frequency bandwidth. Psychometric sensitivity and Oculometric sensitivity for these patterns increased with exposure duration. However the best stimuli for ocular following (namely those with a large bandwidth for spatial frequency) was well integrated up to about 150 - 200 msec, while the best stimuli for speed discrimination (small bandwidth) was well integrated up to about 300 msec. Interestingly, discriminability of ocular tracking eye movements follow a non-monotonic time course, due to the contribution of motor noise. These results suggest that although perception and action relies work in synergy, they may be described by two different integrating mechanisms: A low level, fast one guiding the ocular movement to enable one to catch stimuli in the visual fi eld quickly; and a slower one being able to measure the speed difference between two objects translating in the visual fi eld.

    abstract = {Under natural viewing conditions, large eye movements are interspace by small eye movements (microsaccade). Recent works have shown that these two kinds of eye movements are generate by the same oculomotor mechanisms (Goffart et al., 2012) and are driven from the same visual information (Simoncini et al., VSS 2012 abstract). These results seem to demonstrate that microsaccade and saccade represent a continuum of the same ocular movement. However, if the role played in vision perception by large saccades is clearly identified, the role of the microsaccade is not clearly defined. In order to investigate the role of microsaccade, we measured pattern discrimination performance using an ABX match-to-sample task during the presentation of 1/f natural statistics texture where we varied the spatial frequency contents. We compared perceptual performance with eye movements recorded during the task. We found that the rate of microsaccadic movements changed as a function of the subjects task strategy. In particular, in the trials where the perception of the difference between the stimuli was simple (low spatial frequency) the subjects used the information provided by all the stimuli to do the task and the microsaccadic rate for all the stimuli (ABX) was the same. However, when the perception of the difference between the stimuli was harder (for instance for high spatial frequency), the subjects rather used the information provided by the last two stimuli only and the microsaccadic rate for the image BX increased respect at the image A. These results demonstrate that microsaccadic eye movements also play a role during the analysis of the visual scene and that such experiments can help decipher their participation to perception of the scene.

    abstract = {The repeated presentation of an identical visual stimulus in the receptive field of a neuron may evoke different spiking patterns at each trial. Probabilistic methods are essential to understand its functional role within the neural activity. In that case, a Poisson process is the most common model of trial-to-trial variability. However, the variance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean, irrespective of measurement's duration. Numerous studies have shown that this relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of electrophysiological recordings show an ``em overdispersion'' effect: Responses that exhibit more inter-trial variability than expected from a Poisson process alone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify overdispersion is the Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is largely applied and studied but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this paper, we address three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial distribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts. Second, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological data by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that overdispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We apply this test to three neurophysiological tests along the visual pathway. Finally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a population decoding task. This shows that more knowledge about the form of dispersion tuning is necessary to have a significant gain, uncovering a possible feature of the neural spiking code.},

    abstract = {The repeated presentation of an identical visual stimulus in the receptive field of a neuron may evoke different spiking patterns at each trial. Probabilistic methods are essential to understand its functional role within the neural activity. In that case, a Poisson process is the most common model of trial-to-trial variability. However, the variance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean, irrespective of measurement's duration. Numerous studies have shown that this relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of electrophysiological recordings show an ``em overdispersion'' effect: Responses that exhibit more inter-trial variability than expected from a Poisson process alone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify overdispersion is the Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is largely applied and studied but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this paper, we address three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial distribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts. Second, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological data by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that overdispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We apply this test to three neurophysiological tests along the visual pathway. Finally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a population decoding task. This shows that more knowledge about the form of dispersion tuning is necessary to have a significant gain, uncovering a possible feature of the neural spiking code.},

    abstract = {Natural scenes generally contain objects in motion. The local orientation of their contours and the direction of motion are two essential components of visual information which are processed in parallel in the early visual areas. Focusing on the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey (V1), we challenged different models for the joint representation of orientation and direction within the neural activity. Precisely, we considered the response of V1 neurons to an oriented moving bar to investigate whether, and how, the information about the bar's orientation and direction could be encoded dynamically at the population activity level. For that purpose, we used a decoding approach based on a space-time receptive field model that encodes jointly orientation and direction. We based our decoding approach on the statistics of natural scenes by first determining optimal space-time receptive fields (RFs) that encode orientation and direction. For this, we first derived a set of dynamic filters from a database of natural images~[1] and following an unsupervised learning rule~[2]. More generally, this allows us to propose a dynamic generative model for the joint coding of orientation and direction. Then, using this model and a maximum likelihood paradigm, we infer the most likely representation for a given network activity~[3, 4]. We tested this model on surrogate data and on extracellular recordings in area emphV1 (67 cells) of awake macaque monkeys in response to oriented bars moving in $12$ different directions. Using a cross-validation method we could robustly decode both the orientation and the direction of the bar within the classical receptive field (cRF). Furthermore, this decoding approach shows different properties: First, information about the orientation of the bar is emerging ıt before entering the cRF if the trajectory of the bar is long enough. Second, when testing different orientations with the same direction, our approach unravels that we can decode the direction and the orientation independently. Moreover, we found that, similarly to orientation decoding, the decoding of direction is dynamic but weaker. Finally, our results demonstrate that the orientation and the direction of motion of an ambiguous moving bar can be progressively decoded in V1. This is a signature of a dynamic solution to the aperture problem in area V1, similarly to what was already found in area MT~[5]. $[1]$ J. Burge, W. Geisler.

    abstract = {A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with respect to a generative model. The present study details the complete formulation of such a gen-erative model intended to probe visual motion perception. It is first derived in a set of axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We then extend previous con-tributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of the Gaussian dynamic texture model. First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggrega-tion of warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Second, these textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation (sPDE). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly, texture synthesis using time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the log-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are finally essential for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the model to probe speed perception in humans psychophysically using zoom-like changes in stimulus spatial frequency content. The likelihood is contained within the genera-tive model and we chose a slow speed prior consistent with previous literature. We then validated the fitting process of the model using synthesized data. The human data replicates previous findings that relative perceived speed is positively biased by spatial frequency increments. The effect cannot be fully accounted for by previous models, but the current prior acting on the spatio-temporal likelihoods has proved necessary in accounting for the perceptual bias.},

    abstract = {Most studies of cor tical network dynamics are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood cou- plings, e.g., [Kumar, Schrader, Aer tsen, Rotter, 2008, Neural Computation 20, 1--43]. Neuronal connections in the cor tex, however, show a complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range connections, the latter featuring a so-called patchy projection pattern, i.e., spatially clustered synapses [Binzegger, Douglas, Martin, 2007, J. Neurosci. 27(45), 12242--12254]. The idea of our project is to provide and to analyze probabilistic network models that more adequately represent horizontal connectivity in the cor tex. In par- ticular, we investigate the effect of specific projection patterns on the dynamical state space of cor tical networks. Assuming an enlarged spatial scale we employ a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometr y of dendrites and axons. We simulate the network dynamics using a neuronal network simula- tor NEST/PyNN. Our models are composed of conductance based integrate-and-fire neurons, representing fast spiking inhibitor y and regular spiking excitator y cells. In order to compare the dynamical state spaces of previous studies with our network models we consider the following connectivity assumptions: purely random or purely local couplings, a combination of local and distant synapses, and connectivity structures with patchy projections. Similar to previous studies, we also find different dynamical states depending on the input parameters: the external input rate and the numerical relation between excitator y and inhibitor y synaptic weights. These states, e.g., synchronous regular (SR) or asynchronous irregular (AI) firing, are characterized by measures like the mean firing rate, the correlation coefficient, the coefficient of variation and so for th. On top of identified biologically realistic background states (AI), stimuli are applied in order to analyze their stability. Comparing the results of our different network models we find that the param- eter space necessar y to describe all possible dynamical states of a network is much more concentrated if local couplings are involved. The transition between different states is shifted (with respect to both in- put parameters) and shar pened in dependence of the relative amount of local couplings. Local couplings strongly enhance the mean firing rate, and lead to smaller values of the correlation coefficient. In terms of emergence of synchronous states, however, networks with local versus non-local or patchy versus random remote connections exhibit a higher probability of synchronized spiking. Concerning stability, preliminar y results indicate that again networks with local or patchy connections show a higher probability of changing from the AI to the SR state. We conclude that the combination of local and remote projections bears impor- tant consequences on the activity of network: The apparent differences we found for distinct connectivity assumptions in the dynamical state spaces suggest that network dynamics strongly depend on the con- nectivity structure. This effect might be even stronger with respect to the spatio-temporal spread of signal propagation. This work is suppor ted by EC IP project FP6-015879 (FACETS).},

    abstract = {Most studies of cortical network dynamics are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood couplings [1], focussing on a rather local scale. Neuronal connections in the cortex, however, show a more complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range patchy connections [2,3] as shown in the figure: It represents a tracer injection (gray areas) in the GM of a flattened cortex (top view): Black dots indicate neuron positions, blue lines their patchy axonal ramifications, and red lines represent the local connections. Moreover, to include distant synapses, one has to enlarge the spatial scale from the typically assumed 1mm to 5mm side length. As it is our aim to analyze more realistic network models of the cortex we assume a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometry of dendritesand axons [3]. Here, we ask to what extent the assumption of specific geometric traits influences the resulting dynamical behavior of these networks. Analyzing various characteristic measures that describe spiking neurons (e.g., coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient), we compare the dynamical state spaces of different connectivity types: purely random or purely local couplings, a combination of local and distant synapses, and connectivity structures with patchy projections. On top of biologically realistic background states, a stimulus is applied in order to analyze their stabilities. As previous studies [1], we also find different dynamical states depending on the external input rate and the numerical relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic weights. Preliminary results indicate, however, that transitions between these states are much sharper in case of local or patchy couplings. This work is supported by EU Grant 15879 (FACETS).

    abstract = {Most studies on the dynamics of recurrent cortical networks are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood couplings. Neuronal cortical connectivity, however, shows a complex spatial pattern composed of local and remote patchy connections. We ask to what extent such geometric traits influence the '' idle'' dynamics of two-dimensional (2d) cortical network models composed of conductance-based integrate-and-fire (iaf) neurons. In contrast to the typical 1 mm2 used in most studies, we employ an enlarged spatial set-up of 25 mm2 to provide for long-range connections. Our models range from purely random to distance-dependent connectivities including patchy projections, i.e., spatially clustered synapses. Analyzing the characteristic measures for synchronicity and regularity in neuronal spiking, we explore and compare the phase spaces and activity patterns of our simulation results. Depending on the input parameters, different dynamical states appear, similar to the known synchronous regular '' SR'' or asynchronous irregular '' AI'' firing in random networks. Our structured networks, however, exhibit shifted and sharper transitions, as well as more complex activity patterns. Distance-dependent connectivity structures induce a spatio-temporal spread of activity, e.g., propagating waves, that random networks cannot account for. Spatially and temporally restricted activity injections reveal that a high amount of local coupling induces rather unstable AI dynamics. We find that the amount of local versus long-range connections is an important parameter, whereas the structurally advantageous wiring cost optimization of patchy networks has little bearing on the phase space.},

    abstract = {NeuralEnsemble (http://neuralensemble.org) is a multilateral effort to coordinate and organise neuroscience software development efforts based around the Python programming language into a larger, meta-simulator software system. To this end, NeuralEnsemble hosts services for source code management and bug tracking (Subversion/Trac) for a number of open-source neuroscience tools, organizes an annual workshop devoted to collaborative software development in neuroscience, and manages a google-group discussion forum. Here, we present two NeuralEnsemble hosted projects: PyNN (http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN) is a package for simulator-independent specification of neuronal network models. You can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API, and then run it without modification on any simulator that PyNN supports. Currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM and a VLSI hardware implementation are fully supported. NeuroTools (http://neuralensemble.org/NeuroTools) is a set of tools to manage, store and analyse computational neuroscience simulations. It has been designed around PyNN, but can also be used for data from other simulation environments or even electrophysiological measurements. We will illustrate how the use of PyNN and NeuroTools ease the developmental process of models in computational neuroscience, enhancing collaboration between different groups and increasing the confidence in correctness of results. NeuralEnsemble efforts are supported by the European FACETS project (EU-IST-2005-15879)},
