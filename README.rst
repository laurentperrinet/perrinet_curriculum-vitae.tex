Typesetting your academic cv in LaTeX
_____________________________________

Several dedicated packages ara available to typeset a curriculum vitae or a resume in LATEX, such as europecv or ecv. For some reason I have always found these solutions not flexible enough to suit my needs. This is why I opted for a standard article class as a basis for my CV. Some TeX engines such as XeTeX allow you not only to benefit from the advanced typesetting features available in LATEX, but also to use in your documents expert fonts such as Hoefler Text or Adobe Garamond Pro and to edit TeX sources in your native (Western or non-Western) writing system. This is a custom template based on the Linux Libertine typeface that I designed to typeset an academic curriculum vitae in XeTeX.
