	Abstract = {The quality of the representation of an object's motion is limited by the noise in the sensory input as well as by an intrinsic ambiguity due to the spatial limitation of the visual motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local 1D motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas 2D information takes progressively over and leads to the final correct representation of global motion. A Bayesian framework accounting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of object motion perception is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particularly the time course of its initiation phase. In addition, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of 1D and 2D motion information.},

	Abstract = {Computational Neuroscience is a synthetic, inter-disciplinary approach aiming at
understanding cognition by analyzing the mechanisms underlying neural computations. We
present in this seminar our attempt in modeling low-level vision by bridging different
integration levels, from neural spiking activity to behavior. At the behavioral level, the Ocular
Following Response recorded in the laboratory reveals how the brain may integrate local
information (moving images on visual receptive fields) to produce a single behavioral
response (the movement of the eye). Using a probabilistic representation, we provide a
simple integrative mechanism that gives the ''ideal'' response to possibly noisy and
ambiguous information, similarly to a Bayesian approach. This fits well the performance
revealed by behavioral data and may act as a generic cortical ''module''. At the population
level, these mechanisms may indeed be implemented for the coding of natural images and
we will show the particular importance of spiking representations and lateral interactions for
efficient and rapid responses. In particular, we will present an original unsupervised learning
algorithm that we applied to a model of the primary visual cortex. Finally, at the neuronal
level, I will present work done in the team showing how certain mechanisms at the level of
the synapse and of the neuron are essential at the population level and how we may
understand these mechanisms at the population level. This illustrates the importance of
dynamical processes, distributed activity and recurrent connections to produce a cortical gain
control mechanism. As a conclusion, this approach provides useful applications for image
processing and possible valorization in future computer architectures. More generally, it
proves that the use of a probabilistic representation is a particularly efficient method for
bridging biological versus computational neuroscience and illustrates the advantage of such
an interdisciplinary approach.},

	Abstract = {The machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent
sensorimotor transformation, such as in Ocular Following Response (OFR),
is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the
primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal
observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory (Weiss et
al., 2002) which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to
model the OFR for different levels of noise with full field gratings or
with disk of various sizes and the effect of a flickering surround
(Perrinet and Masson, 2007).
More recent experiments of OFR have used disk gratings and bipartite
stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround
integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the global
spatial integration of motion from an intermediate map of possible local
translation velocities: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving
OFR, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction
selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain
control of the central stimuli (Barthelemy et al., 2006, 2007).
Herein, we extended in the dynamical domain the ideal observer model to
simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues
within a probabilistic representation. We present analytical results
which show that the hypothesis of independence of local measures can
describe the initial segment of spatial integration of motion signal.
Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the dynamical
contrast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for
center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be
added to account for suppressive effects of the surround. We explore
here an hypothesis where this could be understood as the effect of a
recurrent integration of information in the velocity map.

Moving the eyes rapidly to track a visual object moving in a cluttered environment is an essential
function. However, doing so rapidly and efficiently is constrained by a number of noise sources in the
visual system and by the fact that information is collected locally before giving raise to a global signal.
After reviewing some results made in the modeling of low-level sensory areas, I will expose a method
to decode low-level neural information as describing visual information using a probabilistic
representation. Decisions will therefore correspond to statistical inferences which are dynamically
resolving the veridical speed of a moving object. We will illustrate this method by showing how
ambiguous local information can be merged to give raise to a global response which resolves the
aperture problem. Using this theoretical approach "in computo", we will illustrate how we may better
understand results which are observed "in vivo" (optical imaging) as a neural code linking actively
sensation and behavior.},

	Abstract = {Short presentation of a large moving pattern elicits an ocular following response that exhibits many of the properties attributed to low-level motion processing such as spatial and temporal integration, contrast gain control and divisive interaction between competing motions. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys (see poster of Reynaud et al., VSS09). Based on a previously developed Bayesian framework, we have developed an optimal statistical decoder of such an observed cortical population activity as recorded by optical imaging. This model aims at characterizing the statistical dependance between early neuronal activity and ocular responses and its performance was analyzed by comparing this neuronal read-out and the actual motor responses on a trial-by-trial basis. First, we show that relative performance of the behavioral contrast response function is similar to the best estimate obtained from the neural activity. In particular, we show that the latency of ocular response increases with low contrast conditions as well as with noisier instances of the behavioral task as decoded by the model. Then, we investigate the temporal dynamics of both neuronal and motor responses and show how motion information as represented by the model is integrated in space to improve population decoding over time. Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.

	Abstract = {Oriented edges in images of natural scenes tend to be aligned in collinear or co-circular arrangements, with lines and smooth curves more common than other possible arrangements of edges (Geisler et al., Vis Res 41:711-24, 2001). The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an "association field" (Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a more general edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse coding to avoid multiple responses to a single edge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for natural images replicated qualitatively the results from Geisler et al. (2001), confirming that prior information about continuations appeared consistently in natural images. However, we find that the largely man-made environment in which these animals were reared has a significantly higher probability of collinear edge elements. We thus predict that if the lateral connection patterns are due to visual experience, the patterns in wild-raised tree shrews would be very different from those measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with shorter-range correlations and less emphasis on collinear continuations. This prediction can be tested in future experiments on matching groups of animals reared in different environments.},

	Abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to psychophysics and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of  two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independently of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad-hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is  implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This simpler solution may give insights in the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.},

	Abstract = {Oriented edges in images of natural scenes tend to be aligned in collinear or co-circular arrangements, with lines and smooth curves more common than other possible arrangements of edges (Geisler et al., Vis Res 41:711-24, 2001). The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an "association field" (Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al.

@inproceedings{2014-03-20_Manchester,
	Abstract = {The question how the visual system is able to create a coherent representation of a rapidly changing environment in the presence of neural delays is not fully resolved. In this paper we use an abstract probabilistic framework and a spiking neural network (SNN) implementation to investigate the role of motion-based prediction in estimating motion trajectories with delayed information sampling. In particular, we investigate how anisotropic diffusion of information may explain the development of anticipatory response in neural populations to an approaching stimulus. Inspired by a mechanism proposed by Nijhawan [2009], we use a Bayesian particle filter framework and introduce a diagonal motion-based prediction model which extrapolates the estimated response to delayed stimulus in the direction of the trajectory. In the SNN implementation, we have used anisotropic recurrent connections between excitatory cells as mechanism for motion-extrapolation. Consistent with recent experimental data collected in extracellular recordings of macaque primary visual cortex [Benvenuti et al 2011], we have simulated different trajectory lengths and have explored how anticipatory response may be dependent to the information accumulated along the trajectory. We show that both our probabilistic framework and the SNN can replicate the experimental data qualitatively. Most importantly, we highlight requirements for the development of a trajectory-dependent anticipatory response, and in particular the anisotropic nature of the diagonal motion extrapolation mechanism.},

@inproceedings{2016-11-03_gdr,
	Abstract = {Natural environments potentially contain several interesting targets for goal-directed behavior. Thus sensorimotor systems need to operate a competitive selection based on behaviorally meaningful parameters. Recently, it has been observed that voluntary eye movements such as saccades and smooth pursuit can be considered as operant behaviors (Madelain et al, 2011). Indeed, parameters of saccades such as peak-velocity or latency (Montagnini et al, 2005) as well as smooth pursuit behavior during transient blanking (Madelain et al, 2003) or visually-guided pursuit of ambiguous stimuli (Schutz et al, 2015) can be modified by reinforcement contingencies. Here we address the question of whether expectancy-based anticipatory smooth pursuit can be modulated by reinforcement contingencies. When predictive information is available, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) is frequently observed before target appearance. Actions that occur at some distance in time from the reinforcement outcome, such as aSPEM -which occurs without any concurrent sensory feedback suffer of the well-known credit assignment problem (Kaelbling et al, 1996). We designed a direction-bias task as a baseline and modified it by setting an implicit eye velocity criterion during anticipation. The nature of the following trial-outcome (reward or punishment) was contingent to the online criterion matching. We observed a dominant graded effect of motion-direction bias and a small modulational effect of reinforcement on aSPEM velocity. A yoked-control paradigm corroborated this result showing a strong reduction in anticipatory behavior when the reward/punishment schedule was not contingent to behavior. An additional classical conditioning paradigm confirmed that reinforcement contingencies have to be operant to be effective and that they have a role in solving the credit assignment problem during aSPEM.},

	Abstract = {Animal behavior has to constantly adapt to changes, for instance when unexpectedly switching the state of an environmental context. For an agent interacting with this kind of volatile environment, it is important to respond to such switches accurately and with the shortest delay. However, this operation has in general to be performed in presence of noisy sensory inputs and solely based on the accumulated information. It has already been shown that human observers can accurately anticipate the motion direction of a visual target with their eye movements when this random sequence of rightward/leftward motions is defined by a bias in direction probability. Here, we generalized the capacity of these observers to anticipate different random biases within random-length contextual blocks. Experimental results were compared to those of a probabilistic agent which is optimal with respect to this switching model. We found a better fit between the behaviorally observed anticipatory response with that of the probabilistic agent compared to other models such as a leaky integrator model. Moreover, we could similarly fit the level of confidence reported by human observers with that provided by the model and derive a common marker for subject inter-variability, titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation. Such results provide evidence that in such a volatile environment human observers may still efficiently represent an internal belief, along with its precision, and use this representation for sensorimotor control as well as for explicit judgments. This work proposes a novel approach to more generically test human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.},

For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. For example, it has already been shown that when a random sequence of directions of motion to the right or left of a visual target is suddenly biased to one direction, human observers adapt to accurately anticipate it with their eye movements. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where probability biases could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the level of confidence reported by human observers. These results were compared to those of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the event switching generating model. Compared to other models such as the leaky integrator, we found a better match between the behavioral response observed and that given by this agent. Furthermore, we were also able to fit the experimental data with different levels of switching volatility in the model and derive a common marker for the inter-variability of participants, by titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation. Such results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still effectively represent an internal belief, and use this representation in their sensory-motor control system and for explicit judgments.

	Abstract = {In computer vision, the visual search task consists in extracting a scarce and specific visual information (the target) from a large and crowded visual display. This task is usually implemented by scanning the different possible target identities at all possible spatial positions, hence with strong computational load. The human visual system employs a different strategy, combining a foveated sensor with the capacity to rapidly move the center of fixation using saccades. Saccade-based visual exploration can be idealized as an inference process, assuming that the target position and category are independently drawn from a common generative process. Knowing that process, visual processing is then separated in two specialized pathways, the where pathway mainly conveying information about target position in peripheral space, and the what pathway mainly conveying information about the category of the target. We consider here a dual neural network architecture learning independently where to look and then at what to see. This allows in particular to infer target position in retinotopic coordinates, independently to its category. This framework was tested on a simple task of finding digits in a large, cluttered image. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of specifically learning where to look before actually knowing the target category. The approach is also energy-efficient as it includes the strong compression rate performed at the sensor level, by retina and V1 encoding, which is preserved up to the action selection level, highlighting the advantages of bio-mimetic strategies with regards to traditional computer vision when computing resources are at stake.},

@inproceedings{2020-09-14_IWAI,
	Abstract = {Visual search is an essential cognitive ability, offering a prototypical control problem to be addressed with Active Inference. Under a Naive Bayes assumption, the maximization of the information gain objective is consistent with the separation of the visual sensory flow in two independent pathways, namely the "What" and the "Where" pathways. On the "What" side, the processing of the central part of the visual field (the fovea) provides the current interpretation of the scene, here the category of the target. On the "Where" side, the processing of the full visual field (at lower resolution) is expected to provide hints about future central foveal processing given the potential realization of saccadic movements. A map of the classification accuracies, as obtained by such counterfactual saccades, defines a utility function on the motor space, whose maximal argument prescribes the next saccade. The comparison of the foveal and the peripheral predictions finally forms an estimate of the future information gain, providing a simple and resource-efficient way to implement information gain seeking policies in active vision. This dual-pathway information processing framework is found efficient on a synthetic visual search task and we show here quantitatively the role of the precision encoded within the accuracy map. More importantly, it is expected to draw connections toward a more general actor-critic principle in action selection, with the accuracy of the central processing taking the role of a value (or intrinsic reward) of the previous saccade.},
